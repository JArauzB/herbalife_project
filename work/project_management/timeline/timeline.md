# Project Plan and Timeline (Agile)

## How We’re Going to Work (Agile)

We will follow an **Agile approach** with weekly **sprints** from **Thursday to Thursday**. Each sprint will deliver an incremental prototype, allowing us to continuously improve and adjust based on feedback.

### 1. Project Phases (Agile Sprints)
We will organize the project into the same 5 main phases: **Analysis**, **Design**, **Development & Testing**, and **Handover/Deployment**, divided into **one-week sprints**. Each sprint will have a demo to showcase the work done, allowing for feedback and adjustment as needed.

#### Phase 1: Analysis (4 Sprints) (Sept 11 – Oct 7)
- **Objective**: Understand current systems, gather requirements, and analyze the problem.
- **Deliverables**: Requirements Specification, Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), System Architecture, and a Feasibility Study.
- **Sprints**: **Sprint 1 (Sept 11 – Sept 18)**, **Sprint 2 (Sept 18 – Sept 25)**, **Sprint 3 (Sept 25 – Oct 2)**, **Sprint 4 (Oct 2 – Oct 7)**
- **Weekly Prototype/Demo**: After each sprint, we will present progress, such as draft requirements and architecture diagrams.

#### Phase 2: Design (2 Sprints) (Oct 7 – Oct 21)
- **Objective**: Design the system architecture, data models, algorithms, and system workflows.
- **Deliverables**: Detailed system design, wireframes, and workflow diagrams.
- **Sprints**: **Sprint 5 (Oct 7 – Oct 14)**, **Sprint 6 (Oct 14 – Oct 21)**
- **Weekly Prototype/Demo**: Presentation of wireframes, workflow diagrams, and an initial design overview.

#### Phase 3: Development & Testing (7 Sprints) (Oct 21 – Dec 23)
- **Objective**: Develop the core functionalities, including the slotting algorithm and implementing data processing modules. We will create a visual interface for easy inspection and manual corrections. Testing will be integrated within development sprints to adjust based on feedback.
- **Deliverables**: Working prototypes of the slotting algorithm and system integration.
- **Sprints**: **Sprint 7 (Oct 21 – Oct 28)**, **Sprint 8 (Oct 28 – Nov 4)**, **Sprint 9 (Nov 4 – Nov 11)**, **Sprint 10 (Nov 11 – Nov 18)**, **Sprint 11 (Nov 18 – Nov 25)**, **Sprint 12 (Nov 25 – Dec 2)**, **Sprint 13 (Dec 2 – Dec 9)**, **Sprint 14 (Dec 9 – Dec 23)**
- **Weekly Prototype/Demo**: Each sprint will showcase the current state of the slotting algorithm, including visual representation for product placement. Feedback will be incorporated during these sprints.

#### Phase 4: Handover & Deployment (2 Sprints) (Dec 27 – Jan 10)
- **Objective**: Final handover of the project, including documentation, training, and final deployment.
- **Deliverables**: The final system, user manuals, and training sessions.
- **Sprints**: **Sprint 15 (Dec 27 – Jan 3)**, **Sprint 16 (Jan 3 – Jan 10)**
- **Weekly Prototype/Demo**: Present the final system and conduct training sessions.

## Agile Ceremonies and Weekly Progress

We will follow Agile ceremonies during each sprint to ensure continuous collaboration and progress:

- **Sprint Planning (Thursdays)**: We will outline the work for each sprint, define tasks, and set sprint goals.
- **Daily Standups (Optional)**: A brief daily check-in to update on progress, blockers, and next steps (if desired).
- **Sprint Review (Thursdays)**: At the end of each sprint, we will present a demo of the completed work and collect feedback.
- **Sprint Retrospective (Thursdays)**: After the review, we will discuss what went well, what could be improved, and plan for the next sprint.

---

## Collaboration and Communication

To ensure smooth communication and collaboration throughout the sprints:

- **Project Management Tool**: Github Scrum Board
- **Version Control**: Code will be managed using GitHub, ensuring transparency and versioning.
- **Communication**: We can use Microsoft Teams, or email for day-to-day discussions, queries, and feedback.

## Weekly Sprint Demo

At the end of each sprint (Thursday), we will provide a **live demo** or **prototype** of what was developed. This will allow us to gather your feedback, make necessary adjustments, and ensure we are building a solution that aligns with your expectations.

## Potential Risks and Mitigation

We are aware that challenges may arise during the project, so we’ve identified potential risks and prepared mitigation strategies:

| **Risk**                        | **Impact**                       | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                    |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inaccurate or incomplete data**| Delays in development            | Validate data early in analysis and have fallback sources.                  |
| **Integration issues**           | Delays in system testing         | Early integration testing with APIs and systems to reduce risks.            |
| **Feedback not received in time**| May delay adjustments            | Set clear deadlines for client feedback to avoid delays in upcoming sprints.|
