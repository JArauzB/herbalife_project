## Jorge notes
Notes of Jorge during the second meeting with customer
### Algorithm
- the max 80% will be changed in the future, so this will be dynamic
- save same orders on a list so that the algorithm does not need to work anymore with repeating orders
- The types of boxes will be extended in the future
- 70% of all orders have 7 or less orders
- Quantity needed in use case description

### Visualization
- The screen should be responsive
- Transparent approach
- There will be boxes, products, box number, product number
- There is only one type of worker
- Show the packing step by step
- Show only 3 buttons of back, next and finish



## Gabriele notes
Notes of Gabriele during the second meeting with customer

- Real-time data processing is critical for the new algorithm. This requirement should be considered when choosing or designing the new algorithm to ensure it can handle live data efficiently.
- Errors often occur when two items of the same type appear in the order. This suggests a potential weakness in the current packing logic when handling duplicate items.
- 80% of orders contain 7 or fewer items, so the algorithm should prioritize efficiency for smaller orders while remaining scalable for larger ones.
- Since the dimensions and weight of the products can vary, the algorithm needs to be scalable to handle a wide range of product sizes and weights. It must also adapt to different order sizes and the variability in product characteristics.
- The customer prefers the new algorithm to follow a pipeline process, where tasks are broken down into stages. This suggests the need for a well-structured and modular algorithm that processes each task sequentially, such as dimension-checking, volume calculation, and optimization in stages.
- There was mixed interpretation of feedback on whether a Genetic Algorithm would be the best approach.
