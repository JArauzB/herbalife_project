# Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of all the components used in the creation of the system. It covers the classes and files necessary for developing the algorithm and visualization components. The implementation is divided into three main areas:

1. **Algorithm**: This includes the core functions of the packing process.
2. **Visualization**: This provides a 3D User Interface, helping workers understand how to pack boxes effectively.
3. **Tests**: This includes scenarios designed to verify and validate the behavior of both the algorithm and the visualization components.

# Algorithm

The algorithm is the core of the system, responsible for efficiently packing orders.

**[Go to Algorithm Overview](./algorithm/overview.md)**

# Visualization

The visualization component provides a clear 3D view of the packing process. This helps workers understand and replicate the algorithm's results. It is specifically designed for use within the Herbalife company.

# Tests

The testing framework ensures code reliability by simulating a variety of scenarios. It includes tests for both the algorithm and visualization components, ensuring robust and error-free operation.
