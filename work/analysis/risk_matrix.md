## Identified Risks

### 1. Incorrect Box Selection Algorithm
- **Description:** The new algorithm may not adequately account for specific product dimensions, resulting in incorrect box selections.
- **Risk Owner:** Development Team
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Countermeasure:** Conduct thorough testing of the algorithm to ensure it accurately selects appropriate box sizes for various product dimensions.

### 2. Performance Issues
- **Description:** The developed Python program may encounter performance issues, particularly when handling large volumes of data or complex product arrangements.
- **Risk Owner:** Development Team
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Countermeasure:** Apply performance optimization techniques and conduct stress tests to ensure the program can handle expected loads.

### 3. Scope Creep
- **Description:** The project may face scope creep due to additional feature requests, such as further optimizing the box size or creating more detailed visual outputs.
- **Risk Owner:** Project Manager
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Countermeasure:** Clearly define the project scope at the outset and manage feature requests to avoid scope creep.

### 4. Incomplete or Inaccurate Data
- **Description:** There is a risk that the product dimension data may be incomplete or inaccurate, leading to incorrect box size recommendations.
- **Risk Owner:** Data Management Team
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Countermeasure:** Implement a thorough data validation process, including cross-checking dimensions with physical inventory and using automated tools to flag inconsistencies.

### 5. Integration Issues with Legacy Systems
- **Description:** The new cubing algorithm may face challenges when integrating with existing warehouse management systems.
- **Risk Owner:** IT Development Team
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Countermeasure:** Conduct a comprehensive systems compatibility analysis early in the project and allocate time for extensive testing during the integration phase.

### 6. Delays in Development Timeline
- **Description:** Development of the cubing algorithm could encounter unforeseen technical challenges, leading to delays.
- **Risk Owner:** Project Manager
- **Probability:** High
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Countermeasure:** Establish a buffer in the project timeline for unexpected issues and maintain regular progress reviews to identify potential delays early.

### 7. Lack of Stakeholder Engagement
- **Description:** Key stakeholders may not be adequately engaged throughout the project, leading to misalignment with business goals.
- **Risk Owner:** Project Manager
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Countermeasure:** Schedule regular stakeholder meetings to provide updates and gather feedback, ensuring that all parties are involved in decision-making processes.
