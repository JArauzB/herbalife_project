<b>As a Warehouse Manager</b>, I want the cubing algorithm to accurately calculate the best box size for various product shapes, so that we can minimize wasted space and reduce shipping costs.

<b>As a Distribution Center Worker</b>, I want the algorithm to provide clear packing instructions, so that I can efficiently pack products without needing to repack boxes multiple times due to miscalculations.

<b>As a Product Development Team Member</b>, I want the cubing algorithm to adapt to new product dimensions automatically, so that we can streamline the introduction of new items without manual updates to the system.

<b>As a Logistics Coordinator</b>, I want the algorithm to select boxes that maximize space utilization based on 3D shapes, so that we can minimize the number of oversized boxes used and reduce "shipping air."

<b>As a Quality Assurance Tester</b>, I want to test the algorithm with a variety of product shapes and dimensions, so that I can ensure it accurately predicts the optimal packing arrangement before it goes live.

<b>As a Supply Chain Manager</b>, I want the algorithm to provide recommendations for box sizes based on historical data of product dimensions, so that we can anticipate packaging needs and reduce delays in processing.

<b>As a Customer Service Representative</b>, I want to assure customers that our packaging process is optimized, so that I can enhance their confidence in our delivery efficiency and reduce complaints related to delays.

<b>As an IT Specialist</b>, I want the algorithm to integrate seamlessly with our existing inventory management systems, so that we can implement the solution without disrupting our current operations.
