### Problem:
Herbalife faces an optimization challenge in its warehouse system. The existing algorithm, while effective for larger orders, performs poorly for smaller orders due to its reliance solely on volume-based calculations. This approach ignores product dimensions, leading to inefficiencies in box selection and overall resource utilization. The key requirements are:

**Efficiency:** The algorithm must process 90,000 order lines quickly.

**Accuracy:** Ensure proper box selection based on both volume and dimensions.

**Scalability:** Handle the large dataset without compromising on performance.
